Hello! This is my post for lab 5 regarding Schemas and SQL Databases.


### Assumptions
Throughout this lab, I made many assumptions about how the tables should be put together.
My main assumption was that if something has the possibility to be referenced more than once, it needs its own table.
I also had so assume how entity relations worked and do some research on that as I missed the class period where we went over that.
The final main assumption I made is that there should be a name as well as some other information about the buyer and the seller.
