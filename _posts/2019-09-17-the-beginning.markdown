So you're thinking about starting a [YouTube](https://youtube.com/c/awriterish) channel.  Or live streaming on [Twitch](https://twitch.tv/awriterish) or [Mixer](https://mixer.com).  And you have no idea where to start.  But by looking for help we know that you are on the right track.

There are many things that you can do to help just start up your channel.  The primary one would be to share your channel with your friends and/or family members.  Reaching 100 subscribers on YouTube is a very difficult task, and having those people give you a bit of an extra boost is definitely going to help.

The second step is to make videos like you had a million subscribers instead of for the amount of subscribers you currently have.  Making high-quality videos is a great way to grow your channel quickly.  You do not need great equipment to make high quality videos. Just make sure that
 - You're recording at at least 30 frames per second
 - There is good audio quality
 - You know/have a good idea of what you're going to say

And if you are just starting out and cannot afford much, almost all modern smart phones are high enough recording quality to make videos.  If you are screen recording, programs such as [OBS Studio](https://obsproject.com/) exists for desktop and screen recorders can be found wherever you get your apps.  As for editing, I recommend using [Davinci Resolve](https://www.blackmagicdesign.com/products/davinciresolve/), a free, powerful, professional colour grading suite and editor.

Finally, don't get discouraged.  It normally takes *years* for a channel to even reach 100k subscribers, and months to even just reach 100.  Don't give up because you never know when you'll go viral.

Good luck,
