My blog now has a style!  This style is called Long Haul and can be found [here](https://github.com/brianmaierjr/long-haul).  I had quite a few issues with styling this blog.  I first off tried to use the [Massively](https://github.com/jekyllup/jekyll-theme-massively) theme, however I could not get it to work whatsoever.  However, massively is a beautiful theme and if you can get it to work, I highly suggest using it.

Another issue that I ran into was when originally running the bundle install, where it would install an outdated version of the tzinfo gem. I do not know if this was an issue for others, but it can be simply solved by running the command `bundle update tzinfo`.  Beyond that, everything is making sense so far.  Everything else is very intuitive, and I'm looking forward to customizing this webpage even more!

I'm not going to lie, I had to redo this blog multiple times while trying to figure out how to install a theme, and this is what my third attempt at blog looks like.  As you can see, I got pretty efficient by the end, being able to do this in about an hour.

All in all, this project has definitely shown me how to grow from my mistakes, and I'm super excited for what this may lead to!
